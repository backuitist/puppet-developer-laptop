# Puppet developer laptop

Provisionment for developer work stations. Similar to [Boxen](https://boxen.github.com/) but focused on Linux rather than Mac OS X.

To execute, run the following command:

    wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/backuitist/puppet-developer-laptop/master/remote-install.sh | bash

wget and bash should be already installed on your system.
